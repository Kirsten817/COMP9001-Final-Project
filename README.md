# COMP9001-Final-Project

üéÆ Project Overview
Ace of Catcher is a command-line baseball catcher simulation game. You play as a catcher, partnering with the pitcher to navigate a full inning. By analyzing batter attributes, selecting pitch types and locations, and responding to dynamic situations such as base stealing, you take control of the game‚Äôs rhythm and outcome.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
* Variety of Pitch Types and Locations: Choose from fastballs, sliders, and changeups, combined with tactical zones such as high inside or low outside. Batter decisions are dynamically calculated based on pitch quality and personal traits. Batters are modeled after the original lineup from Ace of Diamond, while pitchers are inspired by multiple characters from Ace of Diamond and Oblivion Battery.
* Intelligent Batter Behavior Model: Each batter has attributes like reaction, discipline, speed, and memory. Their swing decisions depend on pitch zones and types, and are influenced by the outcomes of previously faced pitches.
* Realistic Stat Tracking: Tracks strikes, balls, outs, base occupancy, and pitcher performance after every pitch to simulate an authentic game pace.
* Base-Stealing Mechanism: Speedy runners may attempt to steal bases. As the catcher, your reaction time within a limited window determines whether the runner is caught or succeeds.
* End-of-Inning Summary and Outcome Feedback: The inning automatically ends after three outs or three runs allowed, with varied performance-based commentary reflecting your success.
